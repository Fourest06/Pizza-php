Pizza is a web application developed with PHP and SQL, following a tutorial by Net Ninja. This app allows users to create and view pizzas with ease.

Customizations:

Responsive Navbar: The navbar was modified to be responsive, ensuring a better user experience on various screen sizes.

Responsive Layout: Pizzas are displayed uniformly in height, arranged in 3 columns on large screens, 2 columns on medium screens, and 1 column on small screens.

Note: These changes were made by me and are not included in the original tutorial.

Tutorial: This project is based on the Net Ninja tutorial. You can view the tutorial [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pWG7ajC_OVo&list=PL4cUxeGkcC9gksOX3Kd9KPo-O68ncT05o) for more details on the development process.
